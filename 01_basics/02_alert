  alert() in the Browser Console
✅ What it is:
alert() is a built-in browser function that shows a popup dialog with a message.

🔸 Example:
js
Copy
Edit
alert("Hello from browser!");
🔸 Result:
A popup message box appears with “Hello from browser!”

It pauses execution until you click "OK"

📌 Used For:
Simple debugging

User notifications

⚙️ alert() in Node.js
❌ Not Available:
Node.js is a server-side environment — it has no GUI, so alert() doesn’t exist.

🔸 Example:
js
Copy
Edit
alert("Hello from Node.js");
🔸 Result:
vbnet
Copy
Edit
ReferenceError: alert is not defined
📌 Why?
alert() is part of the window object, which doesn’t exist in Node.js.

Node is built for backend tasks — use console.log() or other logging tools.

✅ Alternatives in Node.js
Instead of alert(), use:

js
Copy
Edit
console.log("Hello from Node.js");
Or show messages with libraries like:

inquirer (for interactive CLI)

readline

chalk (for colored console output)

---------------------- What is the window Object?----------------------



In browsers, the window object is the global object. It represents the browser window (or tab) and provides access to everything in the web page environment.

📦 Think of it as:
A giant container that holds all browser-related functionality like:

alert()

console

document (DOM)

setTimeout()

localStorage, etc.

🔹 Example:
js
Copy
Edit
alert("Hello");
is actually the same as:

js
Copy
Edit
window.alert("Hello");
Because:

js
Copy
Edit
alert === window.alert  // ✅ true
🧠 What is in window?
js
Copy
Edit
console.log(Object.keys(window));
You'll see many browser APIs:

window.location → Current URL info

window.document → HTML DOM

window.navigator → Browser info

window.localStorage → Local storage

⚠️ In Node.js
There is no window, because Node doesn't run in a browser.

Instead, the global object in Node is called global.

js
Copy
Edit
// Node.js
console.log(global); // Shows all global properties
